Hi,
I run a mobile pet grooming business that began in 2019. Our business has recently grown considerably as people allow us back into their homes. With this increase, we need 
an organized method of keeping track of our customers (and their pets). We need to record the pet owner's name, adress, what kind of pet they have, the name of their pet, 
price per grooming, frequency of service, and the date we picked them up.

Questions:
Q)What are your options for frequency of service?
A)We only offer weekly and biweekly service.

Q)Do you need to keep track of previous customers?
A)Yes, at present, we have had no customers drop us, but we should have a column available for when we need it.

Q)Do you offer your services for all animals?
A)No, we only offer grooming for dogs, cats, rabbits, and guinea pigs.

Q)Can one customer have multiple pets?
A)Yes, we record each pet seperately, and just repeat the owner's information for each pet.

Reports:
1)We need a list of how many of each pet we currently have.
2)We need a list of those who have multiple pets, include how many pets they have.
3)We need to know our top customer - the customer that is paying us the most.
4)We need to know the average amount we make per animal type
