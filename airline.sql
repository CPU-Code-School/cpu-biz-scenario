I have an airline called 'Fly Air' and flights are getting booked 
but I can't keep track on how many people I have on each flight? and who's flying?

Each flight has a flight number on each route for each time they leave, and I can have multiple flights a day on the same route,
so I would need to keep track on how many people have booked on each flight,
when you book the flight you would only need to provide your name and DOB and address 
but in order to be checked in and travel we need the passport details as passport number, date of issue, expiry date, and nationality.

The reports I need is as following:
    1) How many people booked per flight, as flight number, departure airport, when the flight is departing, destination.
    2) Who isn't checked in for flights departing in the next week, in order to send them reminders to check in.
    3) How many flights are departing per day, and num of passengers we have on those flights.
    4) How many flights are departing per destination, and num of passengers we have on those flights, to know what route is attracts most people.
    5) How many people booked but in the end they didn't travel.
    6) How many flights does each person have (to know for frequent flyer status), as last name, first name, number of flights.

Question: What's the flight numbers you use?
Answer: We have three letters from our name 'FLY' and then 3 digits starting from 001.

Question: What age are your passengers?
Answer: The law requires that passengers on our flights must all be adults, 
    so we require they should be at least 16 years old, but we would allow if they turn 16 that year.
    And the oldest we would allow is 90 for medical reasons.

Question: What type of passports do your passengers have?
Answer: All passengers that are traveling with us have passports that has 9 digits in it and starts with any digit except 0.

Question: Can you book 2 seats for 1 passenger?
Answer: No, you can only have 1 seat per passenger per flight.

Question: How old can a passport be in order to travel?
Answer: Depends if the destination is in same country, it will just need to be valid.
    Same will be if destination is to home country.
    But if it's a international flight, it needs to be maximum 9 years and 6 month after it was issued.
    But bare in mind that a passport that is from before 16 years old is just for 5 years.

Question: How long before flight can you book?
Answer: Up to 1 year before the flight, check in opens 30 days before departure.
