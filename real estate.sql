/*
I run a residential Real Estate business based in Lakewood, NJ since 2009. We don't actually own the houses, we are just the realtors.
Until now we only bought and sold in Lakewood. We didn't even enter the town into our sytem because it was a given. 
Now, with the rapid growth of the community, there isn't much to buy and sell in Lakewood anymore.
We began to expand to buy and sell in Jackson, Toms River, Howell, Brick , and Manchester. We now need to record what town each house is located in.
When we tried to amend our program we noticed many weaknesses in our current system. We decided we are best off starting from scratch.

We record the address of the house and the town the house is in. 
We then record the type of house (bi-level, colonial, ranch, split-level, duplex, townhouse or vacant land), and the sqare-footage of the house. 
We also want to record amount of Bathrooms and Bedrooms.
We don't do any renting, we do sometimes sell individual apartments.
We need to record who owns the house and which one of our realtors is working on this house. We also need to record who our client is.  
Sometimes houses are owned by entities so we need to know who is the individual we are in contact with.  We also want to record on what date 
the house was put on the market and if it was sold. If it was sold, we need to know the following: who it was sold to, date sold, asking price and selling price.
If the house is not sold, record if it is in contract. 

Q: Do you enter the houses into your system before they are officially on the market?
A: No.

Q: Are houses ever sold before they are put on market?
A: No, sometimes they are sold the same day

Q: Do you have any other types of houses besides for what was listed above? 
A: No, we do sell apartments once in a while.

Q: Do you deal with houses out of the towns listed above? 
A: Not as of yet, but with  the rapid growth of the area, you never know.

Q: What's the least and most you would sell a house for?
A: We don't sell houses for less than $100,000. Even when we sell apartments, we only sell if we could sell for $100,000. So far we never sold 
for more than 1.5 Million. With today's inflation and rising Real Estate market, I want the system to allow up to 9.9 million

Q: Do you ever sell for less than the asking price?
A: We don't

Q: Do you want to record the Square footage of the house or the plot of land? 
A: Both, put it in 2 seperate columns

Reports:

1) I want a report of all the houses sorted by the block and then by the town/city
2) I want a report of all the houses sorted by realtor
3) a report of how long it took for each house to sell
4) the price difference from the asking price to the sold price
