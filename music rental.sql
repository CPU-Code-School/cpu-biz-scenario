Hi, I run a music rental shop called The Music Note. 
People rent instruments from me for short periods of time. 
I need a system that will help keep track of all my instruments. 
I need to know the name of the instrument, category, and cost of renting it per month. 

Each instrument I own has a unique ID that I need to know as well. The ID is the first 3 letters of 
the intrument name and first 3 letters of instrument category.

If the instrument has been returned already, I need to know the total profit I made (assuming there was no expenses involved)

I also need to know the date rented and the date returned.

In addition, I need to know the name  of customer.

One more thing - the date and time the rental was inserted into the system (for records purposes)

Is there a min and/or max amount of months to the rental?
Yes - min is one month and max is 12 months. After 12 months, the rental contract needs to be renewed again. 
(But the customer can rent the same instrument again)

Can a customer rent an instrument in advance?
No - he has to come into the store and do it then.

Do you have more than one of each type of instrument?
Yes, I have many of the more popular instruments.

Reports:
1) I need to know if I have any repeat customers and what they rented
2)I need to know the most popular category of instrument that has ever been rented
3) I need to know which instrument (that is not being currently rented) made the most profit
4) I need to know which instruments were rented for only one month (so I could know if I should just sell
them off)
