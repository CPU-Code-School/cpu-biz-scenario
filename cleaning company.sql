/*  
First of all thank you for doing this job. I am confident your company is the perfect choice for the work I need to have done.

I have been running a small cleaning business since January 15, 2017 called Spruce Up.
Recently, due to COVID-19, there have been many changes to keep track of - many have chosen my service to keep the virus from their house.
Unfortunately, a few of my elderly customers have dropped my service because of their fear of letting people potentially carrying the virus into their house.
I feel like I'm now at a point where it's neccessary to store my records electronically so i can keep track of everything in a more orderly and accurate way.

First of all, I need the first and last names of my customers as well as their phone number and address. 
I offer weekly or bi weekly (once every two weeks) cleaning. 
I have worked out with each customer a specific rate to charge per hour depending on how cluttered the house is or how hard it is to clean. 
I would also like a column for the number of hours I have calculated to be the average time I spend cleaning each house. 
In addition I would like a column that computes how much money I earn from each customer at the end of the month.
The other thing I need to include is the date I started working for each customer as well as an end date for those who have chosen to discontinue my cleaning service.

Question: Did you start cleaning for any of your customers before the official start of your business in 2017?
Answer: I did do a bit of cleaning for friends before then, which is what inspired me to start the business. 
    None of these people, however, are in my records. I help them out as a friend every now and then for no cost. 
Question: What is the highest price you charge for cleans including deep cleans?
Answer: For regular cleans I charge up to $35.00 per hour.
        For deep cleans the highest I would ever charge is $53.00 per hour.
        For total price it never computes to more than $424.00 even for deep cleans.
Question: Do you have customers in your records more than once if you do other jobs for them?
Answer: Yes we do have a few instances where we do a customer's house as well as their beach house, airb&b, office or rental.
        In these cases, the jobs are recorded separately under the customer's name.                
Question: What do you want to see in the address?
Answer: All my jobs are local so I only need to know the house number, and street name.
Question: Do you take any time off work?
Answer: Every so often I take a couple days off, but I always add customers to different days 
        so by the end of the year the weekly customers have 52 services and the bi weekly 26 services.
        
Reports:
1) I offer deep cleans for each customer on request. Deep cleans take twice as long as normal cleans.
   I charge 50% more than a regular clean in that house. 
   For this I need to see the customers phone number, last name and the amount of money they will have to pay.
   Please do it in this format:  last name, first name (phone number) - price of service.
2) I would like to know how many months I have been working for each current customer. 
   If you could show the customers I have worked for for the longest time at the top, I would appreciate that.
   Please include a column formatted like this: last name - weekly/bi weekly and a column for number of months
3) What is the average price I ask per hour for regular cleans and what is the average price per hour for deep cleans?
4) Which customer do I earn the most money from in a year? (not counting deep cleans)
   And how much do I get from them?
5) How many customers did I gain in the year 2020 and how many did I lose?

These are my customers:
