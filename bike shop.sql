Hi, I am the owner of a bicycle shop located in Spring Valley, NY. I opened my shop in June of the year 2022. I sell new and used bikes to a variety of customers. The second hand bikes I sell are fixed up to as good as new before being sold. 
It has been getting too hard to keep track of my sales in my trusty notebook so I was referred to your company to help me out and keep track of my orders electronically. I am confident that you will do an excellent job.

For each bike sold I need the customers name, address and phone number.
It's important for me to keep track of the bike company, size and color. I need to record the date I received the bike, the date I sold it and in what season I sold the bike. I need to know if I am selling a new or second hand bike. 
If the bike was used and I am reselling it I want to record the condition it was in when I received it. The purchase price and the price I sold the bike for needs to be recorded in the table. 

These are the four conditions I receive used bikes in:
1: Perfect
2: Minor Fixup
3: Major Fixup
4: Restoration


Questions:
Q: Do you ever sell a bike for less than you paid for it?
A: I prefer not, but if I have a bike sitting for a long time I may have to sell it for cheaper than what I paid for it.

Q: Can one customer buy more than one bike?
A: Yes, however it is recorded separately for each bike, they can buy 2 bikes on the same day.

Q: Do you ever sell a bike before you receive it?
A: No.

Q: What is the most you ever sold a bike for?
A: My highest selling price won't be more than $3,000.00

Q: Did you buy any bikes before you opened your store?
A: I started buying bikes three months before I opened my store.


Reports:
1) I would like to know how many local customers I have as oppose to out-of-town customers.
2) The amount of bikes sold per season to know what is my busiest season.
3) I need a report with the average, minimum and maximum amount of time a bike was in my store before I sold it. Also show in this report my total profit so far.
4) I need a report with the profit for each sale and show the Customers name, BikeCompany, PurchasePrice, SoldPrice, New/Used.
5) Which is the most popular bike company I sell.
